## My process

I just divided my components into smaller pieces. It was quite a short challenge.

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I completed this challenge within 7,5 hours. It was my first time with React, TypeScript and Tailwind, bundled by Vite. Deployed on Vercel. I created custom use-counter hook to use counting effect inside my components. I also used useState and useEffect hooks. I'm not really sure if I used TypeScript here properly.

I had problems with json file and icons path. I placed them in my public folder. I have read that it's not a good approach. Please tell me how I can code it better.

Btw. I don't like Tailwind, I don't like inline styling at all. Sass FTW :)
